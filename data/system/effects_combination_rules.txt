# Do not combine hard clipping effects

# Do not filter redundantly, so do not insert a filter that will operate in a frequency range filtered out by a preceding effect.
# Simple version of rule: do not combine filter effects.

# Do not combine frequency freeze effects of different kinds, it just looks stupid to have two different effets chained that does the same job
